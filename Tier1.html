			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
			<p>I would like for the introduction of the video to be a product of your own. Be creative and find a fun and creative way to introduce 
			our company using animation if possible with incorporating the logo and the topic of discussion, which is their user management portal. This 
			part of the video sets the tone for the rest of the content, so we need to capture their attention right away.</p>
			
			<p>"We would like to welcome you to your GlobalWorx portal where you can communicate with your retail partners
			and capture the opportunity of increasing sales through transparency of out of stock conditions."</p>
			
			<h2>Logging In</h2>
			
			<p>"In order to access your GlobalWorx portal, please refer to the email you received that contained your company
  			specific login credentials. Enter in your username and password to the URL provided and it will take you to 
  			your home page."</p>
  			
  			<img src="LoggingIn.gif" alt="Logging In" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;">
			
			<h2>Viewing and Sending Messages</h2>
			<p>"Once you are in your home page, you will see any notifications sent to your company under the messaging
			portal. Here you can view the details to any out of stock opportunities created by your retail partners and you can 
			also send communications back to store personnel."</p>
			<img src="Send_Receive_Messages.gif" alt="Sending and Receiving Messages" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;">
			
			
			<h2>Updating Contact Information</h2>
			<p>By navigating to the admin tab, your portal gives you control over your company's contact information by allowing 
	        you to edit your employees profile. Select the employee you wish to update and you can easily edit their email and contact number.
	        You may also change your 3 tier protocol by navigating to the contact management link. Select the employee you wish 
	        to change by store and update on the fly."
	        </p>
			<img src="UpdatingContactInfo.gif" alt="Updating Contact Information" style="max-width:90%;height:auto;">
			
			
			<h2>Viewing your Schedule</h2>
			<p>By selecting the "My Schedule" tab, you can view the history of any out of stock opportunities created by your retail partners.
			Sort the schedule by any date range and view detailed notes that were submitted to your company."
			</p>
			<img src="ViewingSchedule.gif" alt="Viewing Schedule" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;">
			
			
			<h2>Viewing Reports</h2>
			<p>Lastly, if you would like to view detailed reporting on your out of stock opportunities, then select the Reports tab. 
			Here you will be able to select your detailed reports and save in a presentable format for further review." </p>
			<img src="ViewingReports.gif" alt="Viewing Reports" style="max-width:80%;height:auto;">
			
			
			<h2>Closing and Contact Info</h2>
			<p>Again, use this portion of the video as your own product in creating an exciting exit. Incorportate some of
			the same animation from the intro and leave the user engaged.</p>
			
			<p>"GlobalWorx is excited to partner with your company to drive transparency to 
			out of stock conditions, increase sales that may have been lost in the past and increase your brand loyalty.</p>
